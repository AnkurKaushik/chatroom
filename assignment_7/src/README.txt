High Level Testing
	First, we tested the chat on one computer with multiple chat windows open. Then we added another computer with a client to also join the server and checked to see if it worked appropriately. We tested to see if the music played on each computer and then tried different port numbers since we were getting errors when trying to use 4242. We tested a large number of clients. We tried making several servers on the same port but that didnt work. Since neither of us own a mac we were only able to test on Windows, but it should work on Linux as well.
